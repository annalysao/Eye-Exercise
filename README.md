# Eye Exercise

## Description of the project: 
This project a pair of eyes. As you move your mouse around the page, the pupils of both eyes follow your mouse. The page also changes color every three seconds.

## How to Run: 
1. Download the HTML, CSS, and JS files locally.
2. Drag and drop index.html into your browser.
3. Move your mouse around the page.

### Roadmap of future improvements: 
1. I will add an iris around the pupil. 
2. I will add pop-ups that show at various points of the page that say 'look at me'. When you click or hover over the pop-up, the iris color will change.
